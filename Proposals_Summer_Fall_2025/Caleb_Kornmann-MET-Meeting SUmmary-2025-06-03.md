# Puppet Design and Performance Meeting Summary

Dr. David B Smith
Mr. Caleb Kornmann (MET student)
Zoom, June 3 2025, 2:00 pm.

This document is a summary made by AI Companion in Zoom, and then edited by DBS.  

## üìù Quick Recap

Caleb seeks a research project that can support his mechanical engineering education.  David and Caleb discussed various aspects of puppet design and performance, including mechanical systems, shadow puppetry, and the integration of AI and technology. They explored ideas for improving puppet mechanics, materials, and visual effects, with a focus on creating more realistic and engaging performances. The conversation also covered software tools for modeling and design, as well as potential research projects and collaborations for future puppet-related endeavors.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

* **Caleb**

  * Brainstorm ideas for improving shadow puppet joints and articulation, as well as new materials for puppet components  using Fusion 360 and Inventor Pro.
  * Explore ways to hide or minimize the visibility of puppet actuators and control mechanisms.
  * Research PyTorch and TensorFlow for potential AI applications in mechanical engineering projects.
  * Email David when ready to arrange another meeting to discuss ideas and create a scope of work.

* **David**

  * Provide additional links and resources for further exploration of shadow puppet theater concepts.
  * Determine the appropriate framework (internship, independent study, research project) for Caleb's involvement.

* **Joint Goal**

  * Aim to have puppet joint solutions in place by the end of the fall semester for integration into the spring production.
