Hello Professor Smith,

I hope you're doing well. I’ve made some progress on the Lumbra project and have a few updates and questions I’d like to review with you. Would you be available for a brief Zoom meeting sometime this week?

Please let me know what time works best for you.

Best regards,
Jabber Bin Kibria
