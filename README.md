## Spring 2025  
#### Research Teans
CHI-UberTeam  
[Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre (BSP) Spring Production](https://github.com/orgs/CHI-CityTech/teams/bsp-spring-production)  
The Spring Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre Production, with expanded script, puppets, and technology.  This semester, we integrate front projection, as well as the introduciton of textile-based scenery that blends with projection.  We also extend the script, explore more articulated puppetry, some with machine or mechanism control, compose original music, and engineer a more sophisticated surround sound system.

Crystal Sanchez - Scenic Textile Artist 
Sam Cheung  -  Visual Design. ("Seni Rupa AI")
Sam Cheung - Physical Puppetry design ("Perancang Wayang Teknologi"), puppeteer ("Dalang")
Anthony Navarro - AV Designer,

Nazanin Munroe - Textile Designer, scenic and costume.      
David B. Smith - Production Manager.    

[UnReal Environment](https://github.com/orgs/CHI-CityTech/teams/unreal-environment)  
Developing a virtual half of the Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre.  This semester we investigate the way that shadows and light sources combine within the UnReal Environment, and then we work to import equivalent assets used in the physical production.  This sets the stage for future ibtefgrations between physical and virtual environments.  

Rodrigo Vega - Virtual (Unreal) Shadow Puppet Stage System and Mechanics.  
Hugo Sanchez - Virtual Asset importing and document.  

[AI Media Control](https://github.com/orgs/CHI-CityTech/teams/ai_media-control)  
Using AI in realtime to collaborate on design and media delivery.  This semester, we look to inject AI into real-time decision making processes, by selecting images from a dataset based on text or spoken input from the stage and its environments. 

Edward Gonzalez - AI-Driven Media Control for QLab Using Open Sound Control (OSC)
Kazi Islam - Realtime Collaborative AI for Shadow Puppet

[CHIIDS-Website](https://github.com/orgs/CHI-CityTech/teams/chiids-website)  
Public facing and brand development.  This semester, we integrate two separate CHI websites by moving one from Google Sites to OpenLab, and another from Google Sites to GItHub Pages.  These test cases will aid us in effecting a more uniform web-based eco-system.  The other initiaticve in this is to design and develop
