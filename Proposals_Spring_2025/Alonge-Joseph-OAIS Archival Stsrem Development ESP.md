**Statement of Work (SoW)  
Emerging Scholars Research Project  
Deployment of a Prototype Open Archival Information System (OAIS) for CHI Shadow Puppet Inventory**

**1. Project Title:**  
**Investigating the Deployment of a Prototype Open Archival Information System (OAIS) for CHI Shadow Puppet Inventory**

**2. Researcher Information:**  
Scholar: [Name]  
Status: Sophomore, Computer Systems Major  
Research Interests: Digital Archiving, Data Storage & Preservation

**3. Project Overview:**  
This research project investigates the real-world deployment of a prototype **Open Archival Information System (OAIS)** in accordance with the **ISO OAIS Reference Model**. The focus is on developing an archival system to catalog and preserve the **CHI Shadow Puppet Inventory**, including both **historical artifacts** and **newly manufactured puppets** for the CHI Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre production. The scholar will explore best practices in digital archiving, data structuring, and long-term storage solutions, aligning with the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework** for managing mediation pathways between virtual, physical, and conceptual spaces.

**4. Project Objectives:**  
- Develop sufficient competency in the OAIS Reference Model to design and deploy a functional prototype archival system.
- Investigate and implement storage formats suitable for shadow puppet documentation, including:
  - **High-resolution photography**
  - **3D scans of artifacts and manufactured puppets**
  - **Formatted instructions and templates for digital refabrication**
  - **Virtual objects designed for integration within 4D simulation virtual worlds**
- Analyze mediation pathways of objects as they transition between physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces.
- Produce a research **poster presentation** summarizing findings and key outcomes of the project.

**5. Project Scope:**  
The scholar will:
- Conduct a **literature review** on OAIS and relevant archival methodologies.
- Assess real-world case studies of digital archive deployments.
- Design an **OAIS-compliant digital repository** prototype for CHI's shadow puppet inventory.
- Digitally archive a select subset of historical and manufactured puppets.
- Evaluate and refine system capabilities based on usability, scalability, and accessibility.
- Document key findings for academic dissemination, including a **poster presentation**.

**6. Deliverables:**  
- **OAIS Prototype System:** A working model for CHI’s shadow puppet digital archive.
- **Dataset of Archived Puppets:** Including high-resolution images, 3D scans, structured metadata, and 4D virtual objects.
- **Research Documentation:** A structured report on deployment challenges, solutions, and lessons learned.
- **Poster Presentation:** A visually engaging summary of research for the Emerging Scholars Program.

**7. Methodology & Technical Approach:**  
- Study **ISO 14721 OAIS Reference Model** and analyze its applicability to this project.
- Utilize open-source or institutionally supported digital repository platforms.
- Capture and process **high-resolution images and 3D scans** for archival purposes.
- Structure metadata according to OAIS principles, ensuring **long-term preservation**.
- Explore **digital fabrication templates** as a means of preserving and reproducing artifacts.
- Develop **virtual objects for 4D simulation environments**, exploring how these models interact with both archival and performative contexts.
- Align findings with **BBS principles** related to mediation pathways between virtual, physical, and conceptual domains.

**8. Timeline:**  
| Week | Task  |
|------|------|
| 1-2  | Literature review on OAIS and case studies of digital archives  |
| 3-4  | Prototype system architecture and metadata schema development  |
| 5-6  | Data collection: High-resolution photography & 3D scanning  |
| 7-8  | Implementation, testing, refinements, and final documentation  |

**9. Expected Outcomes & Significance:**  
This project will provide a **functional digital archive** that preserves and organizes CHI’s shadow puppet inventory, offering long-term access and potential for future research and reproduction. Additionally, it contributes to the broader **BBS framework** by examining how objects transition across mediation pathways between physical, virtual, and conceptual dimensions.

**10. Faculty Mentor & Support:**  
- **Faculty Advisor:** [Advisor’s Name]  
- **Research Support:** CHI Lab, Digital Archiving Resources, Emerging Scholars Program

**11. Conclusion:**  
This research project aligns with **interdisciplinary digital archiving efforts** and advances knowledge on **OAIS deployment** while supporting CHI’s commitment to preserving cultural artifacts. The **poster presentation** will serve as a key deliverable, summarizing both the technical and conceptual findings from this study.
