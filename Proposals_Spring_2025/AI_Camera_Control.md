# Scope of Work (SOW): AI-Driven Video Camera Control for Real-Time Dynamic Interactivity

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-driven solution that dynamically controls a video camera based on real-time interactivity and environmental inputs. The system will integrate computer vision, motion tracking, and automated decision-making to optimize camera angles, zoom, and focus, ensuring high-quality video capture without manual intervention.

## 2. Objectives
1. **Automated Camera Control**  
   - Develop AI algorithms to adjust camera positioning (pan, tilt) and zoom levels in real time.
   - Enable dynamic focus control to maintain clear and crisp footage.

2. **Real-Time Subject Tracking**  
   - Implement subject detection and tracking, allowing the camera to follow multiple moving subjects.
   - Handle occlusions, fast movements, and changing lighting conditions.

3. **Dynamic Interactivity**  
   - Implement interactive triggers (gestures, voice commands, or signals) that dictate camera behavior.
   - Provide live feedback to the camera operator or system through an intuitive user interface.

4. **Scalability & Modularity**  
   - Design the system so that it can be integrated with various camera models.
   - Develop a modular software architecture that can be customized for different use cases (e.g., sports, live events, surveillance).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Technical Requirements
- **Hardware**:  
  - AI-compatible video camera(s) with motorized pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) functionality.  
  - GPU-enabled or equivalent hardware to run real-time AI inference.

- **Software**:
  - AI/ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) for model training and inference.  
  - Computer vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV) for image processing.  
  - Integration with control protocols (e.g., VISCA, ONVIF) to manage PTZ.

- **Data Handling**:
  - Data pipeline for processing video feeds in real time.  
  - Automated recording and logging of camera control decisions.

### 3.2 Functional Requirements
- **Pan-Tilt-Zoom Control**:  
  - System must continuously adjust camera orientation and zoom based on AI detection.
- **Multiple Subject Tracking**:  
  - AI should recognize and follow multiple targets simultaneously, prioritizing them based on configurable rules (e.g., distance, size, motion).
- **User Interface**:  
  - Real-time dashboard that displays AI-detected subjects and camera movements.  
  - Interactive controls to override AI decisions, set manual parameters, or select specific focus points.
- **Notifications/Alerts**:  
  - Optional push notifications or status updates when unexpected behavior or errors occur.
