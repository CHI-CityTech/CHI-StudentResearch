**Internship Scope of Work (SoW): Anthony Navarro - Spring 2025**

**Internship Title:** Technical Lead for SeaChange360 Fabric & Projection Testing  
**Total Hours:** 120 hours (including 30 hours completed in Fall 2024)  
**Focus Areas:** Test Design, Projection Testing, Fabric Analysis, Immersive System Development, Documentation  
**Organization:** Center for Holistic Integration  
**Supervisor:** Dr. David B. Smith  
**Project:** SeaChange360 Fabric & Projection Testing Initiative  
**Date:** February 2025

### **Overview**
Mr. Navarro will complete his internship by serving as the **technical lead** for the [**SeaChange360 Fabric & Projection Testing Project**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Reality-Performance-System/blob/main/SeaChange360/Documents/SeaChange360_Testing_Proposal.md), focusing on evaluating different projection surfaces and their compatibility with various projection technologies. This involves conducting systematic testing of front and rear projection capabilities, light diffusion properties, and projection alignment using various test images. 

The work will contribute to the documentation and analysis required for optimizing projection materials for immersive environments. This initiative is a critical component of the **SeaChange360 immersive installation**, which is currently undergoing prototype development at **City Tech, CUNY Brooklyn**.

### **Primary Responsibilities**

#### **1. Test Design & Setup (30 hours)**
- Construct the testing framework for fabric and projection evaluations.
- Cut and prepare various projection fabrics for experimentation.
- Identify appropriate test images for structured evaluations.
- Acquire and configure capture equipment (cameras, light meters, etc.).
- Set up and align projectors, screens, and measurement tools.
- Conduct an initial **pilot test** to validate methodology and refine testing procedures.
- Document system configuration and setup.

#### **2. Projection & Fabric Testing (40 hours)**
- Execute structured tests for multiple fabric types in **front and rear projection**.
- Assess performance based on **brightness, contrast, and image clarity**.
- Document elasticity, tensioning behavior, and overall durability.
- Explore additional experimental materials beyond the core test set.

#### **3. Projection Alignment & Test Image Analysis (30 hours)**
- Conduct tests using structured test images and real-world projection scenarios.
- Evaluate edge blending and alignment techniques to optimize seamless projections.
- Identify best practices for projection in **blackout and controlled lighting conditions**.

#### **4. Documentation & Reporting (20 hours)**
- Maintain detailed testing logs and **quantitative analysis**.
- Provide qualitative observations and insights from each test.
- Consolidate findings into a structured report for future project reference.
- Contribute documentation to the **SeaChange360 project repository**.

#### **5. Integration with Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS) (20 hours)**
- Assess how tested materials and projections align with broader **Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)** principles.
- Assist in preliminary planning for applying the findings to upcoming **immersive performance environments**.
- Support continued development of **projection and lighting strategies** for interdisciplinary projects.

---

### **Key Outcomes**
- Completion of **fabric and projection testing** with comprehensive documentation.
- Development of a structured dataset evaluating materials for **SeaChange360**.
- Analysis of **best-performing projection fabrics** for immersive environments.
- Integration of findings into the **Blended Reality Performance System**.
- Contribution to future research on **immersive projection technology**.

### **Timeline & Reporting**
Mr. Navarro will maintain weekly progress reports and log hours as per internship requirements. 

- **Phase 1 (0–30 Hours):** **Test Design & Setup** – Framework construction, fabric preparation, pilot testing.
- **Phase 2 (30–70 Hours):** **Projection & Fabric Testing** – Structured testing and data collection.
- **Phase 3 (70–100 Hours):** **Projection Alignment & Analysis** – Edge blending, image calibration.
- **Phase 4 (100–120 Hours):** **Final Documentation & Integration** – Report completion, BRPS alignment.

Progress updates will be submitted weekly to the project repository and discussed during team meetings.

### **Next Steps**
Upon completion of the internship, Mr. Navarro will transition to his **Culmination Project**, where he will serve as **Sound Designer & Engineer** for the **Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre performances**. The sound system for this project will integrate multi-channel immersive audio synchronized with video projections, with **QLab** as the central control system. 

The **Culmination Project Proposal** will be drafted following the finalization of this revised Internship SoW.
