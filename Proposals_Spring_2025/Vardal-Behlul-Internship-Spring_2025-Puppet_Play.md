# Internship Proposal: Behlul Vardal, Emerging Media Student 

**Project Title**: Development of Facial Puppetry and Dynamic Perspective Tools  
**Intern**: Behlul Vardal  
**Supervisor**: Dr. David B. Smith  
**Institution**: Center for Holistic Integration.  
**Term**: Spring 2025  

## 0. Introduction (2025-01-31)

This proposal is a draft, aiming to further roll out the project ideas as represented in Mr. Vardal's draft proposal as presented in [this proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jk3jePsfXePXplEfK4QRrBrpC35RKUXlmCGC1g-vIng/edit?usp=sharing).  After a one hour brainstorming session on January 31, 2025 with Dr. David B. Smith, further refinements were suggested.  This document must be further vetted by Mr. Vardal to ensure that it fits into his own expectations.  An important part of this project will also be to connect it with other CHI initiatives, such as Blended Shadow Puppet, Blended Reality Performance System, and others.  

## Statement of Work (SoW)

### 1. Project Overview

Behlul Vardal’s internship focuses on the development of two  projects that blend emerging media technology with artistic expression: both will expand his ability to design, structure and execute software applications.

#### **1.1 Puppet Game (Primary Focus for the Semester)**
- A facial tracking application enabling users to control a simplified animated face using their own facial expressions.
- Motion tracking detects gestures such as smiles, blinks, and other facial movements, which will be mirrored in a virtual puppet character.
- The application will be developed as an iPad app, with potential environments including Apple Xcode and Unity.
- **Research and Development Process:** The project’s specific features and final scope will be determined iteratively. Initial phases will focus on refining the core concept, exploring game mechanics, and allowing for further refinement based on testing and feasibility studies.

#### **1.2 Dynamic Perspective Tool (Secondary, Research-Oriented Focus)**
- A tool designed to assist artists with maintaining consistency across frames and panels in animation, webtoons, and other digital artworks.
- Allows users to adjust parameters such as field of view, rotation, lens size, scale, and camera angle to generate perspective guides dynamically.
- May be integrated into existing digital art platforms (Photoshop via JavaScript, Krita via Python, or Blender as an alternative development environment).
- **Research and Development Process:** Initial research will evaluate use cases, identify workflow problems for digital artists, and establish a prototype framework before implementation.

## 2. Research Questions & Objectives

### **2.1 Puppet Game**
1. What level of facial tracking accuracy is required for an engaging user experience?
2. How can motion data be best represented in a stylized 2D puppet?
3. What UI design approach ensures an intuitive and playful interaction for children?
4. How does real-time feedback affect user engagement with facial puppetry?
5. What are the computational limitations of mobile platforms for real-time face tracking?

### **2.2 Dynamic Perspective Tool**
1. How can perspective tools enhance workflow efficiency for animation and webtoon artists?
2. What parameters are essential for dynamically adjusting perspective?
3. How can AI integration help automate perspective correction?
4. How do different digital art platforms handle perspective transformation, and what are the technical constraints?

- Conduct structured usability tests with iterative refinements.
- Document research findings, challenges, and future work opportunities.
- Present findings and demonstrate the prototype to the advisor and peers.

### **3.2 Dynamic Perspective Tool Research Plan**
#### **Phase 1: Research & Specification (Weeks 1-6, Ongoing)**
- Survey digital artists and animation professionals to identify common perspective-related challenges.
- Research existing solutions and define gaps in current tools.
- Identify key features that improve workflow efficiency.
- Outline technical feasibility for Photoshop, Krita, or Blender integration.

#### **Phase 2: Prototype Exploration & Feasibility Testing (Weeks 7-12, Time-Permitting)**
- Develop small-scale prototypes testing core perspective-related functionalities.
- Conduct feasibility testing for real-time perspective adjustments.
- Experiment with different UI/UX approaches for accessibility.

#### **Phase 3: Evaluation & Future Development Recommendations (Weeks 13-15)**
- Assess initial prototypes and document findings.
- Provide recommendations for further development or integration into existing digital art tools.

## 4. Technical Requirements & Tools

- OpenCV or ARKit for face detection and tracking
- Unity’s built-in facial recognition tools (if using Unity)

### **4.2 Dynamic Perspective Tool Implementation**
- JavaScript scripting for Photoshop
- Python scripting for Krita
- Python integration for Blender (alternative approach)

### **4.3 Collaboration & Version Control**
- GitHub repository for project management.
- Weekly progress documentation and journaling.
- Discord for ongoing discussions and feedback.

## 5. Evaluation & Assessment

### **5.1 Technical Feasibility**
- Ability to refine and develop a functional prototype for facial puppetry.
- Progress in research and conceptualization of the dynamic perspective tool.

### **5.2 Creativity & Innovation**
- Development of engaging UI/UX elements.
- Novel approaches to facial tracking and digital perspective adjustments.

### **5.3 Documentation & Communication**

- Behlul to continue to refine and specify each of these projects.

## 7. Conclusion
This Statement of Work attempts to provide a research-driven approach to the **Puppet Game** and **Dynamic Perspective Tool** projects. By integrating iterative development, usability testing, and structured evaluation, this internship provides Behlul with hands-on experience in emerging media technology while producing meaningful research deliverables. The approach allows for flexibility in defining and refining the ultimate scope while maintaining structured milestones for progress. This document is a draft: a final document will need to be generated that better integrates these ideas with Mr. Vardal's goals.
