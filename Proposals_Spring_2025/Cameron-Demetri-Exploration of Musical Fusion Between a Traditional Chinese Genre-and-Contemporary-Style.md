## 1. Introduction
This Statement of Work (SoW) details a project that investigates how to combine a traditional Chinese musical genre with a modern style referred to as “Wave.” The project will involve several phases of research, musical analysis, experimentation, and compositional output, culminating in a portfolio of demonstration pieces and a supporting analytical document.

### Connection to the BSP World Building Project
This fusion study not only stands as a unique musical experiment but also aligns seamlessly with the broader BSP World Building Project, in which an entire fictive universe underpins the events, characters, and narratives central to BSP. By carefully studying and honoring the traditions from which we draw, we highlight each culture’s intrinsic relevance and showcase its richness—while simultaneously introducing innovative hybrids that combine elements of traditional Chinese music with the modern “Wave” style. These cross-genre explorations enrich the fictional realm’s cultural and sonic palette, turning music into a powerful narrative tool that deepens immersion and shapes the mythos, atmosphere, and overall identity of the BSP universe. Through this approach, participants and audiences alike gain a more vivid, cohesive experience of the setting, ensuring that the musical dimension remains as dynamic and integral as the written lore, characters, and visual elements defining the BSP world.

## 2. Project Objectives

- **Identify Major Chinese Musical Genres:**  
  Conduct preliminary research on a range of traditional Chinese musical styles.

- **Select One Chinese Genre for Study:**  
  Narrow down one genre suitable for detailed analysis and fusion with the “Wave” style.

- **Analyze the “Wave” Style:**  
  Examine harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, structural, and instrumental aspects of Wave.

- **Compare and Contrast:**  
  Apply a comparative framework to highlight similarities and differences between the chosen Chinese genre and Wave.

- **Experiment with Fusion Approaches:**  
  Explore several methods for blending the two styles, emphasizing creative variety rather than a single optimal solution.

- **Produce Compositions:**  
  Use FL Studio to create demonstration pieces that illustrate multiple fusion approaches.

- **Document Findings:**  
  Prepare an analytical report detailing the processes, methodologies, and outcomes of the fusion experiments.

## 3. Scope of Work

### 3.1 Research & Selection

**Precedent Research**  
- Identify and study key Chinese musical genres, focusing on historical context and defining features.  
- Determine which genre is most promising for a potential fusion with Wave.

**Wave Style Analysis**  
- Investigate Wave’s compositional hallmarks: harmony, melody, rhythm, form, and instrumentation.  
- Document any existing precedents or influences that align with East Asian traditions.

### 3.2 Musical Analyses

**Chinese Genre Analysis**  
- Examine melodic structures, tonality (or modal systems), traditional rhythms, and cultural context.  
- Note the typical use of instruments and their roles in ensemble settings.

**Comparative Framework**  
- Synthesize findings into a reference to compare instrumentation, harmonic vocabulary, rhythmic organization, and song form between the chosen Chinese genre and Wave.

### 3.3 Fusion Experimentation

**Approach & Techniques**  
- Introduce substitutions such as performing the Chinese genre with Wave instruments (and vice versa).  
- Overlay rhythmic patterns from one style onto the melodic or harmonic frameworks of the other.  
- Explore variations in balance: Chinese-dominant, Wave-dominant, or an equal mix.

**Fusion Variations**  
1. **Chinese-Dominant Fusion:**  
   Infuse subtle Wave elements (e.g., electronic drum patterns or synth pads) into a primarily Chinese composition.  
2. **Wave-Dominant Fusion:**  
   Root a piece in modern Wave conventions while incorporating Chinese instrumentation or melodic fragments.  
3. **Balanced Fusion:**  
   Strive for an equal blend, ensuring both traditions have significant representation in terms of structure, instrumentation, and style.

### 3.4 Composition & Production

**Compositional Process**  
- Draft sketches in FL Studio to test how different compositional ideas sound.  
- Revise material based on aesthetic goals and technical feasibility.

**Production Techniques**  
- Employ virtual instruments to simulate traditional Chinese timbres and Wave-inspired sounds.  
- Utilize plugins and effects in FL Studio to experiment with mixing, layering, and sound design.

### 3.5 Documentation & Deliverables

1. **Analytical Report**  
   - Provide historical and musical context for both the chosen Chinese genre and Wave.  
   - Outline the methodologies and processes used to achieve each fusion approach.  
   - Reflect on lessons learned, challenges, and future directions.

2. **Musical Compositions**  
   - A portfolio of demonstration pieces showcasing the various fusion methods (Chinese-dominant, Wave-dominant, balanced blend).  
   - Accompanying notes or annotations describing each piece’s key elements.

3. **(Optional) Presentation Materials**  
   - Slide deck, performance notes, or audio samples to explain and illustrate concepts.
