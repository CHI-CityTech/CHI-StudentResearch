# Scope of Work: Automation of Javanese Shadow Puppets using Machine Control

## Project Title: Automated Control System for Javanese Shadow Puppets and Dynamic Set Manipulation

**Students:** Yinson Tso, Kristian Rice, Mukhammadali Yuldoshev, Egypt Paige  
**Mentor:** David B Smith  
**Project Type:** ESP Emerging Scholar Project  
**Discipline:** Mechanical Engineering  
**Software & Tools:** Autodesk Inventor, 80/20 T-slot Framing Systems, Animatronics, CAD Workflows  

## Objective  
The primary goal of this project is to develop an automated system for controlling Javanese shadow puppets and set elements using mechanical engineering principles, CAD software, and computational resources. This project will focus on the design, simulation, and prototyping of animatronic mechanisms that allow for precise movement of puppets and dynamic stage components. The final outcome will provide a modular, scalable system that integrates machine control into traditional shadow puppet performances. The project will integrate with the rest of the shadow puppet team and result in mechanisms that will be presented at the performance in the spring on May 8, and exhibited with the rest of the projects. The student team will work to convert existing puppets into a mechanism that allows for control.

## Research Tools and Skills  
Students will employ a range of research tools and skills, including version control and project management platforms such as GitHub for collaborative development and tracking design iterations. They will utilize Autodesk Inventor for parametric modeling, motion analysis, and mechanical simulations, alongside 80/20â€™s CAD tools for structural design. AI-driven motion replication will be explored using machine learning frameworks and robotic control algorithms. Additional tools include laser cutting and 3D printing for rapid prototyping, stress analysis software for material testing, and real-time control systems for implementing servo and stepper motor actuation. The project will integrate structured documentation methodologies to ensure reproducibility and scalability for future development.

## Student Contributions  
Weekly meetings, project updates, and check-ins will be mandatory. Students will collaborate with each other to plan and execute the proposal. The faculty mentor will be present at the weekly meeting to provide feedback and advice. Students should also identify other potential faculty or CLT resources with specialized knowledge relevant to the specific technologies and techniques employed.

The student team will commit a significant amount of time to research, design, prototyping, and testing, ensuring a high-quality outcome. Each member will be responsible for maintaining thorough records of their work, using GitHub for version control and documentation. Preparatory work for meetings with the mentor will include compiling design updates, simulation results, and problem-solving strategies to facilitate productive discussions. Team members will be expected to contribute to project management by setting and tracking milestones, reviewing technical literature, and refining mechanical designs based on mentor feedback and testing results. Regular communication and collaboration with the shadow puppet team will also be essential to ensure seamless integration of the automation system with the broader performance setup.

## Scope of Work  
This project will take existing puppet designs, manufactured by other members of the BSP team, and then use these designs to replicate their own, automated versions.

- Presentation of findings and demonstration of puppet automation system at the May 8 performance and exhibition.

## Project Continuity and Future Development  
This multi-stage project may not necessarily be completed by the end of the research cycle, but it will establish a solid groundwork for further development in successive cycles. The research, design, and prototyping efforts undertaken in this phase will provide a strong foundation for future teams to refine and expand upon. Documentation, modular designs, and integration with existing automation systems will ensure continuity, enabling iterative improvements and expanded functionalities in upcoming research cycles.

## Conclusion  
This project will modernize Javanese shadow puppetry by integrating mechanical automation, preserving the artistry while expanding performance possibilities. The research and development process will provide valuable experience in CAD modeling, animatronics, and automation, contributing to the advancement of mechanical engineering in performance art applications.
