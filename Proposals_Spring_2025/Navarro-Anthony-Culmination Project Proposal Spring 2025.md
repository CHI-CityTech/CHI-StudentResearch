### **Overview**
For his culmination project, Mr. Navarro will serve as the **Sound Designer and Projection Technical Lead** for the **Spring 2025 Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre Production**. This production is an expansion of the **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Meta-Project**, which integrates traditional shadow puppetry with advanced technology, including immersive audio and projection systems. 

The production will involve developing a multi-channel immersive sound system synchronized with **video projections**, extending the Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS) principles. As a culmination project, Mr. Navarro will independently manage the sound and projection aspects, demonstrating expertise in both technical and creative execution.

### **Primary Responsibilities**

#### **1. Multi-Channel Sound Design & Engineering**
- Design an immersive multi-channel **surround sound system** for the shadow puppet performance.
- Implement spatialized soundscapes using QLab, integrating with projection cues.
- Capture and edit audio assets, including dialogue, ambient sounds, and music.
- Develop a signal flow diagram and speaker placement plan for optimal audience experience.
- Ensure clear sound localization, dynamic mixing, and balanced frequency distribution.

#### **2. Projection System Integration & Technical Oversight**
- Oversee the integration of **projection mapping** with shadow puppet performances.
- Align projection elements with real-time puppetry and scenic elements.
- Develop methods to synchronize **audio and visual cues** for seamless storytelling.
- Experiment with **light and shadow interplay** to enhance visual immersion.
- Document projection calibration methods and system settings.

#### **3. Research & Implementation of Blended Reality Performance Systems**
- Evaluate the BSP meta-project's integration of sound, projection, and physical performance.
- Experiment with interactive projection techniques for audience engagement.
- Explore AI-driven synchronization methods to automate aspects of the performance.
- Contribute findings to the Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS) research.

#### **4. Documentation & Deliverables**
- Maintain a **weekly progress log** tracking milestones and challenges.
- Create a **technical design document** covering sound and projection configurations.
- Provide detailed diagrams and setup instructions for future BSP productions.
- Present the project in the **final poster and oral presentation session** per culmination course requirements.

---

### **Key Outcomes**
- Development of a **multi-channel immersive sound system** synchronized with projection.
- Creation of an **integrated projection and audio workflow** for BSP performances.
- Contribution to the **ongoing research** of the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) and BRPS.
- Technical documentation of sound and projection system implementation.
- Successful execution of a **live performance incorporating sound and projection technology**.

### **Timeline & Reporting**
Mr. Navarro will adhere to the culmination project schedule, with deliverables aligned to course milestones:

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4):** Project proposal finalization, initial sound and projection research.
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8):** Prototype system design, initial testing of sound and projection synchronization.
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12):** Full implementation, calibration, and technical refinements.
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 13–15):** Final performance execution, documentation, and presentation preparation.

#### **Performance Dates & Locations**
- The **Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre** performance will take place in **late April/early May 2025**.
- One performance will be held in **LG-38 Studio** at City Tech.
- A second performance will be part of the **Spring MTEC Student Show**.
- Design and production steps will be structured to ensure completion before the scheduled performances.

Progress will be logged on **GitHub**, with regular meetings with the faculty advisor.
