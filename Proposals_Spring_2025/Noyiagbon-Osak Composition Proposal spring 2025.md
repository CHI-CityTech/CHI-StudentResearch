# **Statement of Work (SoW)**
**Project Title:** Music Composition for the Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Project  
**Internship Duration:** **February 14, 2025 – April 29, 2025** (120 hours)  
**Intern:** Osakpolor Noyiagbon  
**Supervisor:** Dr. David B. Smith, Director Center for Holistic Integration  
**Primary Tools:** Cubase DAW, Virtual Instruments (Gamelan, Yoruba), Qlab Integration 
**Collaborators:** BSP Sound Designer (Anthony Navarro), BSP Technical Team,  BSP Theatrical Team

## **1. Project Overview**
This project involves the **composition and sequencing of music** for the Spring 2025 Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre production. The music will blend **Javanese Gamelan and Yoruba musical traditions**, ensuring cultural authenticity while supporting the theatrical and dramatic needs of the performance.

The final compositions will be developed as **MIDI performances** in **Cubase**, exported as **high-fidelity pre-rendered audio files**, and synchronized to **live-action, video projections, and multi-channel sound cues**. The music must be structured to allow smooth transitions between scenes.

The project will also involve **technical preparation**, including **installation and configuration of Cubase**, script analysis, and the identification of **suitable virtual instruments (VSTs)** for accurate sound replication.

All **research materials, composition drafts, and technical documentation** will be maintained in **GitHub** and **Zotero**.

## **2. Objectives**
### **Research & System Familiarization**
- Analyze the **script** to determine:
  - Where **music is required** (transitions, themes, underscore).
  - What **musical style** is appropriate for different sections.
  - How **musical motifs** can be used to reinforce narrative elements.
- Identify and document **Yoruba musical structures** (scales, rhythms, instrumentation).
- Expand on **existing Gamelan research** in Zotero.
- Identify **notation sources** (MusicXML, MIDI) or manually transcribe patterns.
- Familiarize with **Cubase DAW**:  
  - Install & configure **Cubase software**.  
  - Install and test **virtual instruments (VSTs)**.  
  - Conduct **sandbox composition experiments** (not for final use).

### **Composition & Integration**
- Develop musical themes for **characters, transitions, and underscore**.
- Structure compositions to allow **scene transitions**.
- Ensure MIDI sequences align with **live action and staging requirements**.

### **Technical Implementation**
- Use **Cubase DAW** to sequence, mix, and export compositions.
- Format music for **Qlab integration** to allow precise triggering.
- Collaborate with **BSP sound designer** to ensure spatial audio compatibility.

### **Rehearsal Strategy & Refinement**
- Conduct iterative testing during **BSP rehearsals**.
- Adjust compositions based on **feedback from the director & technical team**.
- Deliver **final performance-ready compositions by April 5, 2025**.

### **Assessment & Documentation**
- Maintain logs of **composition decisions** and **technical workflow**.
- Document **cultural influences and integration strategies**.
- Gather **feedback from the BSP team and audience** for future refinements.

## **5. Rehearsal Strategy**
1. **Feb 18:** **Script Analysis** to determine all musical cues and themes.  
2. **March 12-25:** Test **scene-based compositions** in BSP rehearsals.  
3. **March 25 - April 5:** Refinement based on **director and actor feedback**.  
4. **April 5-20:** **Technical rehearsals** with multi-channel integration.  
5. **April 28 & May 8:** Live performances, ensuring **real-time cue synchronization**.  

---

## **6. Technical & Creative Considerations**
### **Composition Approach**
- Fully **composed sequences**, structured for dramatic flow.
- **Transitions must be smooth**, allowing seamless movement between scenes.
- **Cultural authenticity** must be preserved.

### **Technical Workflow**
- **Cubase DAW** will be used for composition and sequencing.
- **Virtual Instruments:**
  - **Gamelan:** Soniccouture Balinese Gamelan II, Impact Soundworks Javanese Gamelan.
  - **Yoruba:** African percussion sample libraries.
- **Qlab Integration:** Music must be formatted for **trigger-based playback**.
