# **Statement of Work (SoW) ‚Äì AI-Driven Media Control for QLab Using OpenAI API & OSC**
**Intern Name:** Edward Gonzalez  
**Internship Type:** Research Internship  
**Total Hours:** **120**  
**Supervisor:** *TBD*  
**Development Environment:** Python, Visual Studio Code (VSC)  
**Project Duration:** Spring 2025  

---

## **1. Project Overview**
This internship builds upon **previous independent study efforts** to develop a **Proof of Concept (PoC) prototype** integrating **AI with theatrical media control systems**. The project will leverage **OpenAI‚Äôs API** for real-time AI communication, interfacing with **QLab via Open Sound Control (OSC)** to manipulate theatrical elements dynamically.

The primary **goal** of this project is to test the feasibility of **AI-driven media automation** in live performance settings. If successful, this system **may be expanded** for use in the **Spring Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre performances**, either **controlling stage elements or influencing the environment surrounding the performance**.

---

## **2. Scope of Work**
Edward Gonzalez will complete the following **core tasks**:

### **2.1 AI-QLab Integration**
- Develop a **Python script** that communicates with OpenAI‚Äôs API.
- Generate **structured AI responses** that can be mapped to OSC commands.
- Establish a **real-time interaction pipeline** between AI and QLab.

### **2.2 Theatrical Element Manipulation**
- Identify a **theatrical element** (e.g., **lighting, sound, projection mapping**).
- Develop logic to **translate AI-generated responses into OSC-based QLab commands**.
- Implement basic **triggering of media cues** based on AI outputs.

### **2.3 System Optimization & Testing**
- **Evaluate system performance** (latency, accuracy, and reliability).
- **Refine error handling** for consistent execution in live performance environments.
- **Document findings** on feasibility, limitations, and potential expansions.

### **2.4 Optional Expansion (Time & Feasibility Dependent)**
- Adapt the system for use in the **Spring Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre performances**.
- Explore **interactive AI-driven environmental effects**, such as:
  - AI-controlled **ambient lighting or projections**.
  - AI-modulated **soundscapes** reacting to performance cues.

## **3. Deliverables**
By the end of the internship, the following deliverables will be completed:

### **3.1 Functional Prototype**
‚úÖ **Python-based AI interface** that sends prompts to OpenAI‚Äôs API and processes responses.  
‚úÖ **QLab integration** using Open Sound Control (OSC).  
‚úÖ **Automated execution of theatrical elements** based on AI-driven commands.  
‚úÖ **Live demonstration** of AI-driven QLab control.  

### **3.2 Documentation**
üìÑ **Code Documentation:** Detailed setup instructions for AI-QLab communication.  
üìÑ **Technical Report:** Analysis of feasibility, performance, and scalability for future research.
