## **Overview**
For my culmination project, I will serve as the **Sound Designer and Projection Technical Lead** for the **Spring 2025 Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre Production**. This production is an expansion of the **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Meta-Project**, which integrates traditional shadow puppetry with advanced technology, including immersive audio and projection systems. 

The production will involve developing a multi-channel immersive sound system synchronized with **video projections** and a musical score, extending the Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS) principles. As part of my culmination project, I will independently manage the sound and projection aspects, demonstrating expertise in both technical and creative execution. I will research and design an appropriate system, participate in technical rehearsals, and control teh system during performances. This system will include a variety of speakers and projectors, all controlled by QLab.  Some There may be some live microphones, but this is TBD.

## **Project Description**
This project focuses on designing and implementing an **immersive audio and projection system** for a live shadow puppet performance. My goal is to integrate sound design and projection techniques to enhance the storytelling experience. I will learn how to manage multi-channel audio, synchronize projection mapping with live performances, and refine my technical documentation skills.

By completing this project, I will gain hands-on experience in **sound spatialization, media synchronization, and live performance technology**, which will prepare me for future work in the entertainment technology industry.

## **Methods**
To achieve the project goals, I will undertake the following tasks:

### **1. Multi-Channel Sound Design & Engineering**
- Design and implement an immersive **multi-channel surround sound system**.
- Use **QLab** to create spatialized sound cues synchronized with projection elements.
- Capture and edit sound assets (dialogue, ambient sounds, music).
- Develop a **signal flow diagram** and speaker placement plan for optimal audience experience.
- Ensure **clear sound localization**, dynamic mixing, and balanced frequency distribution.

### **2. Projection System Integration & Technical Oversight**
- Integrate **projection mapping** with shadow puppetry.
- Align projections with real-time puppet movements and scenic elements.
- Synchronize **audio and visual cues** for a seamless performance.
- Experiment with **light and shadow interplay** to enhance immersion.
- Document projection calibration methods and system setup.

### **3. Research & Implementation of Blended Reality Performance Systems**
- Evaluate BSP’s integration of sound, projection, and live performance.
- Explore **AI-driven synchronization** methods for automation.
- Contribute findings to the **Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS) research**.

### **4. Documentation & Deliverables**
- Maintain a **weekly progress log**.
- Create a **technical design document** detailing sound and projection configurations.
- Provide detailed **diagrams and setup instructions**.
- Present findings in the **final poster and oral presentation session** per course requirements.
