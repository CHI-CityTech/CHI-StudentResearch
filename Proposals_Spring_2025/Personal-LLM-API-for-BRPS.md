## **Project Overview**  
The CHI is seeking a Research Assistant team to explore the **capabilities of emerging Large Language Models (LLMs)** and their integration into the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework**. This project focuses on evaluating **commercial and open-source AI models**, identifying **minimum viable LLM sizes**, and developing strategies for **personalization, maintenance, and multi-modal mediation within BRPS**.  

The research will establish **best practices for AI customization**, progressing from **theoretical evaluation to proof-of-concept (PoC) implementations** that test **AI-human collaboration in real-world scenarios**. This includes API development to **facilitate AI interaction within the Blended Reality Performance System**, ensuring that AI functions **collaboratively as defined by the BBS Framework** rather than as a tool.  

This project aligns with CHIâ€™s broader goals of exploring holistic integration, in this case exploring **AI-human symmetry**, where AI is developed to **collaborate as an equal partner** in mediated performance environments, following BBS principles of **balanced parametric dimensions** across **physical/virtual and space/intelligence interactions**.
