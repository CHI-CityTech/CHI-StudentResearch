# Statement of Work (SoW)

**Project Title:** Music Composition Internship – Eastern and Western Fusion  
**Student:** Eric White  
**Internship Hours Required:** 120  
**Project Period:** (Start Date) – May 8 Presentation  

---

## 1. Project Overview

Eric White will complete a 120-hour internship exploring the fusion of Eastern and Western musical traditions in original compositions. The primary focus is on selecting and analyzing a specific Japanese classical style—such as court music (Gagaku) or taiko drumming—and then blending it with Western musical techniques. All research references, including musical examples and scholarly articles, will be maintained in Zotero, while project documentation and code (where applicable) will be stored in a dedicated GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.

Throughout the internship, Eric will use FL Studio and Serum VST to compose and experiment with sound design. The final deliverable will be presented on May 8 via a poster session, allowing attendees to listen to each composition.

## 2. Project Objectives

1. **Research & Analysis**  
   - Investigate multiple Japanese classical styles (court music, taiko, etc.), comparing their historical context, cultural significance, and musical elements (melody, harmony, rhythm, etc.).  
   - Choose one style for in-depth study based on personal affinity and suitability for fusion with Western elements.

2. **Technical & Creative Development**  
   - Develop skills in FL Studio and Serum VST, focusing on synthesizing timbres that can approximate or enhance traditional Japanese and Western instruments.  
   - Produce compositional sketches that highlight essential qualities of both Eastern and Western styles.

3. **Composition & Synthesis**  
   - Compose a series of original works that include:  
     1. Pure Japanese-influenced pieces.  
     2. Pure Western-influenced pieces.  
     3. Fused hybrid pieces integrating both traditions in thoughtful, creative ways.

4. **Documentation & Presentation**  
   - Store research citations, musical examples, and listening references in Zotero.  
   - Maintain ongoing project documentation (research notes, code, logs, composition files) in a GitHub repository for transparency and version control.  
   - Present the final compositions with a poster session on May 8, featuring listening stations or QR codes to hear the pieces.  
   - Embed at least one piece in the BSP fictional universe to demonstrate cross-cultural “world-building.”
