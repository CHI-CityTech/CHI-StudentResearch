# Fabrication Sound Hammer Revision Project  
## Independent Study Deliverables  
**Reginald Fairley, Jr.**  

### 1. Proposal  

A proposal of one or more paragraphs in length that clearly describes the intended objectives of the study, including anticipated procedures to attain those objectives. This description should be addressed to a non-specialist reader. A relevant bibliography must be included.

The objective of this study is to improve the design and functionality of a previously created toy hammer project that I developed in **MTEC 2250 – Fabrication** class. I plan to refine the device by addressing the shortcomings identified in the prototype and extending the interactive features. The new version of the toy hammer will be sturdier, resistant to breaking, and capable of reacting to surface impact through **sound effects** and **light patterns**. These enhancements will make the hammer more engaging and durable.

The process will begin with an analysis of the original design, identifying its strengths and weaknesses. A revised design outline will incorporate new features and improvements. Necessary materials will be organized, and coding for components such as the **PCB** and **Arduino** will be developed and tested. A **virtual 3D model** of the updated design will be created using **Fusion Autodesk** to guide the fabrication process. Once built, the hammer will be thoroughly tested to determine whether it meets all design specifications. Results from these tests will be recorded to inform future iterations of the project.

#### a. Objectives  
1. Recreate **Fabrication Final Project: Toy Hammer**  
   - Should be sturdy and not prone to breaking  
   - Should react to impact on surfaces  
   - Should produce sounds and/or light patterns  

#### b. Procedure  
1. Analyze previous project build for **pros and cons** within the design  
2. Design outline for what should be **added to the new version** of the fabrication project  
3. Organize **materials** needed for the project  
4. **Code & test** necessary parts: **PCB & Arduino**  
5. Create a **sketch** of how the new project will be built in **3D Modeling Software (Fusion Autodesk)**  
6. **Build** project  
7. **Test** for any faults  
8. **Record results**

### 2. Faculty Supervisor Role  

A statement clearly specifying the expected role of the faculty supervisor in this study (frequency / purpose of meetings with supervisor, anticipated laboratory, studio, or field assistance, etc).  

Dr. **David B. Smith** will serve as the faculty supervisor for this project. He will provide guidance and managerial oversight to ensure that I meet target deliverables effectively. This will include offering **iterative feedback** on design, engineering, and production-related challenges. **Weekly meetings** will be held to review progress. Dr. Smith will also assist in optimizing project workflow and suggest problem-solving strategies. While primarily an advisory role, the supervisor will help ensure that all milestones are achieved within the anticipated timeline.  

Further, all research and output will be **journaled within the GitHub environment**.  

- **Supervisor’s Role:** Advisory – ensuring the project is progressing in the most optimal way.
