## **Background and Need**  
All organizations require a **strong visual identity** that fosters recognition, effectively communicates values, and generates organizational branding. The **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)** is no exception, and proposes to establish a **scalable and adaptable branding system** that will support **current and future meta-projects** while remaining flexible for future growth, and remain true to the core CHI principles.  The existing CHI logo is a recursive Tao (see [image below](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/CHI-Branding/edit/main/proposals/Tourkova-Alexandra-S2025%20Proposal%20-%20CHI%20Visual%20Identity.md#design-approach))  

By establishing a **structured branding process**, this initiative ensures that CHIâ€™s **visual identity remains cohesive across all projects**, while allowing for each meta-projectâ€™s goals and themes to represented in a unique and informational fashion.  

### **Key Goals of this Initiative:**  
- Develop a **unified branding system** that enhances CHIâ€™s ability to **attract collaborators, funding, and participants**.  
- Create **a scalable branding package** that ensures **future meta-projects seamlessly integrate into CHIâ€™s visual identity**.  
- Provide a **clear and professional identity** that enhances CHIâ€™s **marketing, outreach, and engagement strategies**.  
- Establish a **GitHub-based documentation system** that serves as a **living branding repository** for future designers and contributors.

## **Objective**  
The internship will expand the work initiated with the **Anti-Hate logo and recursive fish design** into a **comprehensive branding system** for CHI and its meta-projects.  

### **Key Deliverables:**  
- **Unique logos** for CHI and each meta-project.  
- **Comprehensive branding package** detailing logo usage, typography, and color schemes.  
- **A style guide** defining the **rules for logo creation and brand consistency**.  
- **Digital templates** for various branding applications (social media, presentations, and official documents).  
- **Documentation in GitHub**, ensuring all branding assets are properly stored and version-controlled.  

ðŸ“Œ **GitHub Integration:**  
All project activity will be documented and managed via [**CHIâ€™s GitHub repository**](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/CHI-Branding), including:  
- **Version-controlled digital assets** (logos, branding elements, templates).  
- **Instruction manuals and branding documentation** for future contributors.  
- **Project management and task tracking** via **GitHub Projects**.  
- **Style guide development** within GitHub Wiki for future updates.

## **Design Approach**  
The branding system will integrate **recursive Tao motifs, Escher-like tessellations, and interlocking design elements** to reflect CHIâ€™s principles of **balance, integration, and creativity**.

### **Core Design Elements:**  
- **CHI Core Logo:** The Tao-inspired CHI logo remains the central element.  
- **Anti-Hate Recursive Fish Design:** Forms the **conceptual foundation** for the expanded branding system.  
- **Escher-Like Tessellations:** Used to create **interlocking patterns** emphasizing **connection and balance**.  

### **Meta-Project Logos & Branding Themes:**  
1. **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** â€“ Interlocking design representing the blending of physical and virtual spaces.  
2. **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)** â€“ Puppetry-inspired motifs integrating **light and shadow elements**.  
3. **Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)** â€“ Modular, fractal forms representing **real and virtual interaction**.  
4. **Collaborative AI** â€“ Neural and fractal patterns highlighting **recursion and adaptability**.  
5. **World Building** â€“ Expanding orbits symbolizing **narrative creation and cultural research**.  
6. **Game Development (Lumbra & Shadow Sports)** â€“ Dynamic **light and shadow interplay**.  
7. **Educational & Outreach Initiatives** â€“ A logo reflecting **cross-cultural connections and learning**.  

### **Style Guide & Digital Templates**  
The branding package will include:  
- **Logo Relationships:** How each meta-project visually connects to CHIâ€™s core identity.  
- **Rules for Future Logos:** A system for designing new meta-project logos while maintaining cohesion.  
- **Templates:** For social media, websites, presentations, and printed materials.
