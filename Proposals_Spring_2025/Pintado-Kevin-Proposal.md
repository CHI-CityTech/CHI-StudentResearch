## Proposal Description  

This independent study aims to enhance the digital presence of the **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)** by migrating and developing its core websites. The project will focus on transitioning the existing **CHI Google Site to GitHub Pages** and the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS) site to OpenLab**, integrating these platforms through **CHIIDS principles** of system interoperability and scalability.

To achieve these objectives, **Kevin Pintado** will:
- Conduct foundational research to identify best practices for site migrations and integration.
- Design user-friendly and accessible interfaces.
- Implement the migration using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant tools**.
- Explore **APIs and cross-platform navigation strategies** to synchronize content and provide a seamless user experience.

### Deliverables:  
- Two **fully functional, published** websites.  
- A **partially implemented integration framework**.  
- **Complete documentation** of the process.  
- A **comprehensive assessment report** outlining outcomes and future recommendations.  

This project will provide **practical experience in web development**, **system integration**, and **branding** while building a scalable framework for CHIâ€™s future digital growth.
