## **Statement of Work: Database Development Internship**

**Intern:** Saliou Dunn  
**Advisor:** Dr. David B. Smith  
**Duration:** Approximately 120 hours

### Objective
Design, analyze, and create relational databases suitable for storing structured information to support AI-driven applications within the scope of CHI-sponsored meta-projects. Emphasis will be placed on applications relevant to ongoing projects involving the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework.

### Internship Goals
- Gain expertise in relational database design and management.
- Evaluate and select an appropriate SQL-based database platform (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Create practical, scalable databases relevant to CHI meta-projects (e.g., Shadow Puppet Theatre, AI Puppet Theatre, or other AI-driven projects).

### Primary Activities
1. **Research & Analysis** (Approx. 30 hours)
   - Research relational database structures and methodologies.
   - Evaluate MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other potential database platforms, considering factors like scalability, ease of integration, and performance in AI-based projects.
   - Document database platform comparison and rationale for selection.

2. **Database Design**
- Draft ER diagrams and schema designs that accurately reflect relational data needs.
- Design initial database structures for storing and accessing project-related information, such as student researcher data, technical specifications, and AI integration points.

3. **Implementation**
- Set up and configure selected database systems.
- Populate databases with initial data sets for testing, specifically including current semester's student researcher data.
- Integrate GitHub API, if feasible, to pull student researcher data from GitHub repositories.
- Implement best practices for data integrity, indexing, and query optimization.

4. **Testing and Validation**
- Conduct initial test studies, including the creation and validation of a relational database containing this semester's CHI student researcher information.
- Evaluate database performance, security, and accessibility.
- Iterate designs based on test outcomes.

5. **Reporting and Documentation**
- Provide clear documentation for all database structures, schemas, and any relevant queries.
- Submit progress reports to track internship progress and key learnings.
- Deliver final internship report summarizing database implementation and recommendations for future use.

### Deliverables
- Comparative analysis report of SQL platforms (MySQL vs. PostgreSQL, etc.).
- ER diagrams and finalized schema designs.
- Fully functional database containing current semester's CHI student researcher data.
- Documentation and evaluation report including API integration details if utilized.

### Anticipated Duration
Total effort: Approximately 120 hours

### Supervisor
Dr. David B. Smith

**Outcome:** Upon completion, the intern will have gained significant practical experience in database design and implementation, informed by AI integration needs, enhancing both technical proficiency and applied experience in data science.
