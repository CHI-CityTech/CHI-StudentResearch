# Research Assistant â€“ Personalized LLMs and AI Integration within the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) Framework  
**Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)**  

The CHI is seeking a **Research Assistant** to explore the **capabilities of emerging Large Language Models (LLMs)** and assess their integration into the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework**. This role focuses on **evaluating commercial and open-source AI models**, understanding their strengths and limitations, and determining how **smaller, personalized datasets** can enhance AI adaptability, alignment, and multi-modal mediation.  

The research will establish a **foundation for best practices in AI customization** by investigating existing and emerging methodologies before progressing to **proof-of-concept (PoC) implementations** that test real-world AI-human collaboration.

## Key Responsibilities  

### **Phase 1: Research & Evaluation**  
- **Survey Emerging AI Models:** Analyze the latest **LLMs (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, LLaMA, Falcon, OpenAssistant, etc.)** and assess their capabilities in **text generation, reasoning, and multi-modal integration**.  
- **Benchmark Commercial vs. Open-Source Models:** Compare **proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind)** with **open-source alternatives** to determine trade-offs in **performance, flexibility, and ethical considerations**.  
- **Investigate Personalized AI Approaches:** Explore techniques such as **fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)** to customize AI models.  
- **Assess AI Mediation Pathways in BBS:** Examine how **LLMs process, transform, and relay information** across **multiple sensory modalities** (text, image, sound, movement, etc.) within **Balanced Blended Space workflows**.  
- **Explore Superalignment & Singularity Considerations:** Research **long-term AI alignment strategies**, ensuring **personalized AI remains adaptable and ethically sustainable** in future AI evolution scenarios.  

### **Phase 2: Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Implementations**  
- **Develop Personalized LLM Prototypes:** Fine-tune **smaller, domain-specific AI models** to test their effectiveness in BBS-aligned workflows.  
- **Test AI Integration in Real-World Mediation:** Conduct **experiments with AI-human collaboration**, embedding LLMs in **CHI meta-projects** (e.g., Blended Shadow Puppet, BRPS, CHIIDS) to evaluate mediation effectiveness.  
- **Hybrid AI Deployment:** Design and test **frameworks that combine fine-tuned local models with commercial LLM APIs** to optimize performance, privacy, and adaptability.  
- **Evaluate AI Symmetry & Collaboration:** Determine whether **AI functions as an equal partner or remains tool-like**, refining AI-human interaction models to align with BBS principles.  
- **Document & Disseminate Findings:** Publish results in **technical reports, research papers, and presentations**, shaping the future of AI customization in **collaborative and interdisciplinary settings**.
