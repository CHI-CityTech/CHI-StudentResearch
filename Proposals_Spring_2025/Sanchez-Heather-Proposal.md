## Project Title:
Prototyping for “Dark Room” Performance and Related Merchandise

## Project Overview:
Crystal Sanchez will assist with the development of set designs, costumes, and merchandise for the collaborative performance project “Dark Room.” This multimedia performance explores the fable of the blind men and the elephant, integrating physical and virtual elements. The intern will gain hands-on experience in textile design, fabrication techniques, and collaborative prototyping processes. Additionally, the internship will include merchandise development, blending artistic and commercial applications.

## Objectives:
1. Develop and test textile-based prototypes for set designs, assessing compatibility with projection technologies and lighting systems.
2. Design and fabricate costumes, including custom textiles using experimental inks and repeat pattern motifs.
3. Create and produce merchandise, including screen and block-printed T-shirts, for performance-related sales.
4. Collaborate with other team members, including Anthony Navarro (A/V Intern), to integrate textile and electronic components.
5. Participate in prototype textile testing, focusing on fabric preparation and identification as outlined in the *SeaChange 360* project.
6. Investigate methods for attaching fabrics to structural elements as part of the design process.

## Responsibilities:

### Set Design:
- Assist with fabric cutting, sewing, and surging processes to prepare textiles for testing.
- Experiment with various fabrics for front and rear projection capabilities using different projector types, working in collaboration with the CHI A/V team (currently Anthony NavarroO handling electronic installation.
- Incorporate LED lighting into fabric frames and supports, ensuring aesthetic and functional integration.
- Document results from fabric tests, including observations on texture, color accuracy, and projection fidelity.

### Costume Design:
- Develop repeat pattern motifs inspired by the themes of “Dark Room.”
- Print textiles using experimental inks, collaborating with the Textile Lab to evaluate durability and appearance.
- Sew costumes using the custom-printed textiles, ensuring professional finishes and wearability for performers.

### Merchandise Development:
- Design logos and motifs for “Dark Room” merchandise.  These logos may also be developed in conjunction with another student: Alexandra Tourkova, who is a COMD Visual Design Student.  Here proposal can be found here (**INSERT!!!!**)
- Utilize screen and block printing techniques to create T-shirts and other merchandise items.
- Assist in setting up small-scale production workflows for merchandise fabrication.

### Textile Testing (SeaChange 360):
- Prepare and surge fabric samples for projection testing, focusing on front and rear projection capabilities.
- Participate in identifying optimal fabrics for brightness, contrast, and clarity in blackout conditions.
- Document elasticity, durability, and environmental performance (e.g., response to airflow or temperature changes).
- Collaborate on testing protocols to evaluate fabric properties such as translucency, diffusion, and tensioning behavior.
- Work with the CHI A/V team to analyze findings and guide material selection for immersive installations.

### Fabric Attachment Methods:
- Investigate and prototype techniques for attaching fabrics to structural elements, including tensioning mechanisms, clips, or rails.
- Test the practicality and stability of various attachment methods, ensuring compatibility with structural systems.
- Document and recommend attachment solutions for future use.

### Collaboration and Documentation:
- Work with Anthony Navarro to explore integration of electronic and textile elements in the performance.
- Participate in regular meetings with supervisors to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
- Maintain a detailed log of processes, including materials used, techniques applied, and outcomes achieved.

## Deliverables:
1. **Set Prototypes:**
   - Fabric samples tested for projection compatibility, documented with photos and analysis.
   - Completed set elements incorporating fabric, frames, and embedded LEDs.

2. **Costume Prototypes:**
   - Custom-printed textile samples with experimental inks.
   - Finished costumes showcasing the printed textiles and repeat motifs.

3. **Merchandise Items:**
   - T-shirts and other merchandise items with “Dark Room” logos and motifs.
   - Production-ready designs and documentation for future scalability.

4. **Textile Testing Documentation:**
   - Comprehensive report summarizing results from fabric testing, including quantitative and qualitative metrics.
   - Recommendations for fabric selection and preparation based on *SeaChange 360* testing outcomes.

5. **Fabric Attachment Documentation:**
   - Detailed log of attachment methods tested, including photos, observations, and recommendations for structural integration.

6. **General Documentation:**
   - Detailed log of activities and results, including visual and written records.
   - Final internship summary report highlighting contributions and learning outcomes.

## Resources and Workspace:
- Access to the City Tech Textile Lab for textile design, printing, and fabrication.
- Use of the Center for Holistic Integration (CHI) Lab for collaborative and electronic integration tasks.
- Additional materials sourced from the Textile Lab’s inventory or Material for the Arts.
- Virtual collaborations and documentation within the CHI GitHub environment.

## Timeline (Subject to Change):
- **Weeks 1–2:** Orientation and setup; initial review of materials and equipment for textile and projection testing. Begin collaboration with the CHI A/V team.
- **Weeks 3–4:** Fabric cutting, surging, and preparation for projection testing. Initial experimentation with front and rear projection performance.
- **Weeks 5–6:** Continued fabric testing with CHI A/V team support; begin investigating fabric attachment methods and prototyping attachment solutions.
- **Weeks 7–8:** Development and printing of experimental textiles for costume prototypes. Begin sewing and assembling costume elements.
- **Weeks 9–10:** Logo and motif development for merchandise. Begin production of screen and block-printed T-shirts.
- **Weeks 11–12:** Refine costume prototypes; finalize and test attachment solutions for structural integration.
- **Weeks 13–14:** Assemble and finalize set prototypes, integrating feedback from testing phases.
- **Weeks 15–16:** Complete final documentation of all activities, deliverables, and testing results; submit comprehensive internship report.
