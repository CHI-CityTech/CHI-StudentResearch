# Statement of Work (SOW): Mohammad Sohail – Specialized Bot Development (Spring/Summer 2025)

## Project Title:
**Speculative Bot Design, Testing, and AI Integration**

## Researcher:
**Mohammad Sohail**  
Upper Sophomore, Computer Systems Technology

---

## Project Context:
This is an exploratory research initiative conducted under the **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)**. The project supports voluntary, interdisciplinary, and self-directed student efforts. Mohammad’s work serves as a preparatory phase for a more sustained research project in Fall 2025, with a focus on creating and experimenting with AI-based bots. All work will be documented in GitHub according to CHI protocols.

---

## Project Overview:
The project begins with speculative ideation to identify use cases for a personalized bot. It then branches into two key research tracks:

1. **Literature Review** – explores academic and technical research related to chatbot development, LLMs, and AI-human interaction.
2. **Precedent Research** – investigates and evaluates existing bot systems and frameworks to assess how well they meet the envisioned use cases.

In parallel, Mohammad will experiment with multiple bot platforms using identical prompts to compare behaviors and effectiveness. He will also work on developing a chatbot using Python, while also testing the “Create your own bot” feature in ChatGPT as a fast prototyping environment.

---

## Research Goals:

### Speculative Design Phase:
- Identify desired bot functions and use-case scenarios.
- Define context and design constraints.

### Literature Review:
- Investigate core topics:
  - Chatbot frameworks and architectures
  - Large Language Model training and customization
  - Human-AI communication and usability
- All sources will be collected and annotated in **Zotero**, in alignment with CHI documentation standards.

### Precedent Research:
- Evaluate existing systems:
  - Commercial bots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Pi)
  - Open-source platforms (e.g., Rasa, BotPress, GPT4All)
  - API-based tools (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- Identify:
  - Feature coverage
  - Strengths and limitations
  - Gaps aligned with Mohammad’s goals

### Bot Comparison Protocol:
- Develop a shared prompt bank
- Test multiple bots using identical inputs
- Log and analyze:
  - Tone
  - Responsiveness
  - Accuracy
  - Adaptability/customization

### Hands-On Development:
- Use Python to create a chatbot:
  - Option A: via API to an existing LLM
  - Option B: build a simple foundational chatbot from scratch
- **Explore the ChatGPT “Create your own bot” feature** to rapidly test ideas and capabilities
- Compare both approaches (Python vs. ChatGPT custom bot)
- Reflect on integration potential in Mohammad’s in-development social media app

---

## Deliverables:
- Speculative design document (use cases + functional requirements)
- Zotero-based literature review log
- Precedent research comparison matrix
- Bot testing results (comparative analysis)
- Python chatbot prototype (basic version)
- Summary reflection on integration possibilities
- GitHub repository with:
  - Code
  - Notes
  - README documentation
  - Logs and version tracking

---

## Timeline:
**Spring–Summer 2025**  
**Hours**: Voluntary and flexible, based on availability

---

## Tools & Platforms:
- **Development**: Python, OpenAI API, HuggingFace, Rasa, LangChain
- **Exploration**: ChatGPT "Create Your Own Bot" interface
- **Documentation**: GitHub (required), Markdown, CHI templates
- **Research**: Zotero (for lit review), Google Docs or Notion (optional for planning)
- **Testing**: Prompt bank and structured response logs

---

## Next Phase – Fall 2025:
The current project will lay the groundwork for an advanced research effort in Fall 2025. Potential directions include:
- Custom LLM fine-tuning
- Advanced training techniques
- Bot deployment in a test version of the social media app
