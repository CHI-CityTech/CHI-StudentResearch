## Objective  
The primary goal of this project is to develop an automated system for controlling Javanese shadow puppets and set elements using mechanical engineering principles and CAD software. This project will focus on the design, simulation, and prototyping of animatronic mechanisms that allow for precise movement of puppets and dynamic stage components. The final outcome will provide a modular, scalable system that integrates machine control into traditional shadow puppet performances.  

The project will integrate with the rest of the shadow puppet team and result in mechanisms that will be presented at the performance in the spring on **May 8**, and exhibited with the rest of the projects. The student will work with the team to convert existing puppets into a mechanism that allows for control.

## Scope of Work  

### 1. Research and Concept Development  
- Study traditional Javanese shadow puppet mechanisms and identify key movement patterns.  
- Research existing animatronics and automation techniques applicable to puppet movement.  
- Explore existing systems for modular puppet control structures.  

### 2. CAD Workflow and Design Process  

#### **Initial Sketching:**  
- Develop rough hand sketches to brainstorm potential automation methods.  
- Identify key movement axes (rotation, translation, articulation) for puppets and set elements.  

#### **2D Sketching in Autodesk Inventor:**  
- Translate hand sketches into constrained 2D CAD sketches.  
- Use parametric modeling to enable flexibility in design.  

#### **3D Modeling:**  
- Convert 2D sketches into 3D parts using Autodesk Inventor.  
- Design mechanical linkages, gears, and actuators for animating the puppets.  

#### **Assembly and Motion Simulation:**  
- Integrate individual components into a full assembly.  
- Conduct interference checks and kinematic simulations to ensure smooth motion.  

#### **Design Iterations and Optimization:**  
- Refine system based on mechanical analysis and team feedback.  
- Optimize part connections for strength, weight, and manufacturability.  

#### **Final Documentation:**  
- Generate detailed part drawings, assembly instructions, and a bill of materials (BOM).  
- Create renderings and exploded views for visualization.
