**Title:** CASTI–Mobility Sub-Project: Trust and Mediation in Autonomous Transportation Systems

---

### 1. Overview
The **CASTI–Mobility Sub-Project** functions as the transportation-specific branch of the **CHI Autonomous Systems Trust Meta-Project (CASTI)**. It applies CASTI’s general framework for ethical trust, safety, and mediation to the evolving ecosystem of **autonomous and intelligent transportation systems**—including self-driving vehicles, connected infrastructure, and urban smart-mobility environments.

The sub-project’s mission is to explore how human and computational intelligences share, negotiate, and maintain **mutual trust** within transportation contexts. It serves as a bridge between theoretical research on trust in autonomous systems and the practical, high-risk environments of urban mobility.

### 2. Research Focus
- **Trust and Transparency:** Examine how public trust in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is formed, eroded, and potentially rebuilt through transparency, safety validation, and ethical communication.
- **Safety and Reliability:** Identify measurable indicators of system reliability and safety performance, and study how these correlate with human perception of trustworthiness.
- **Ethical Mediation:** Investigate how moral decisions (e.g., prioritization in unavoidable collision scenarios) can be modeled and communicated in ways consistent with human ethical frameworks.
- **Data Security and Accountability:** Analyze the cybersecurity, privacy, and forensic structures required to maintain legitimate accountability in connected and automated systems.
- **Reciprocal Trust:** Extend beyond public trust in AI to include how AI systems assess and interpret human reliability, intent, and unpredictability in shared environments.

### 3. Objectives
1. Develop a **syntactical model of trust mediation** in transportation systems using the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework.
2. Establish a **risk-tolerant simulation environment** for studying trust and ethical mediation scenarios in virtual and hybrid testbeds.
3. Conduct comparative studies of international approaches to autonomous mobility ethics, safety, and regulation.
4. Define **metrics of safety, reliability, and communication transparency** that support scalable evaluation.
5. Produce open-access research documentation through CHIIDS, contributing to the broader CASTI knowledge base.

---

### 4. Methodology
- **Stage 1 – Speculative and Precedent Research:** Literature review and case studies of autonomous vehicle rollouts in the U.S., Europe, and Asia; mapping public trust trends and regulatory models.
- **Stage 2 – Design and Modeling:** Apply BBS syntax to represent trust flows between human and AI agents; identify breakdowns in safety and communication.
- **Stage 3 – Simulation:** Create controlled environments to model ethical dilemmas and evaluate decision transparency under variable risk conditions.
- **Stage 4 – Publication and Integration:** Archive results in CHIIDS and link outputs to CASTI and related CHI meta-projects (Collaborative AI, Autonomous Control, Built Environment).

### 5. Integration with CASTI
The CASTI–Mobility sub-project operationalizes CASTI’s theoretical foundation in a high-visibility, socially critical context. It provides empirical data and ethical models that feed back into CASTI’s broader investigation of human–AI trust. It also supports CHI’s mission to study **symmetrical mediation** between cognitive and computational intelligences through the lens of **real-world risk**.

This sub-project serves as an experimental platform for:
- Developing **trust mediation models** applicable to other autonomous systems (e.g., drones, healthcare robotics).
- Testing **Collaborative AI** behaviors in ethically constrained, high-risk environments.
- Informing **Autonomous Control** meta-project research on distributed decision-making.

---

### 6. Deliverables
- Research paper summarizing key findings and BBS trust models.
- Comparative matrix of international regulatory frameworks.
- Simulation design document outlining ethical and safety scenarios.
- Repository of BBS syntax maps illustrating trust pathways in mobility systems.
- Workshop or symposium presentation (e.g., CHI Symposium on Collaborative AI and Public Trust).

---

### 7. Student Implementation Pathways
Individual research projects, such as **Sumiya Jahan’s “Trust and Transparency in Smart Mobility Systems,”** function as **subset investigations** within this sub-project. Each student or research assistant may:
- Focus on one or more specific domains (e.g., cybersecurity, ethics, simulation, communication).
- Produce literature reviews, prototypes, and deliverables that contribute directly to the CASTI–Mobility dataset.
- Participate in periodic integration reviews to align findings with CASTI’s overarching trust and mediation framework.

---

### 8. Future Development
Subsequent project phases will:
- Expand the simulation platform to include **multi-agent vehicle coordination** and **human–AI interaction modeling**.
- Collaborate with external partners (e.g., NYC DOT, universities, and industry) for real-world data integration.
- Serve as a foundation for policy and standards contributions through CHI’s interdisciplinary research network.
