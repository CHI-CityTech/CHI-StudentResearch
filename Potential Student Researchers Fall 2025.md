Good afternoon,
 
This semester I decided to take my Internship course credit. I was able to secure an Internship in the beginning of summer at a venue helping the audio specialist set-up for various forms of live entertainment . Sadly, when the semester began the venue was no longer able to accept me as an intern.
 
Now I am searching for a new internship in a hurry and Rennie Brooks told me to email you incase you have any internships available.
 
I am interested in Foley so working with sound and video editing would be most beneficial for my goals ahead. 
 
Please let me know if you have anything for me or any advice for finding internships in my scope.

My name is Francky Duperval and I recently transferred and gotten started in Emerging Media Technology for this semester.

Currently my interest is in experiential media and physical computing and after speaking with professor Berkoy, she recommended I touch base with you and that you were working  with students on an interesting shadow puppet show integrating physical computing and AI.
