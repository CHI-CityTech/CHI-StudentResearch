# CHI Spring 2025 Activities  
During the Spring 2025 semester, the Center for Holistic Integration (CHI) 
During the **Spring 2025** semester, the **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)** continues its interdisciplinary work, moving from research and design into prototyping and implementation. It advances several existing initiatives and adds several new ones. We will be focusing on **producing an expanded Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) Theatre performance**, prototyping the **Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)**, developing a **virtual shadow puppet simulation in Unreal Engine**, refining the **CHI Integrated Digital System (CHIIDS)**, and exploring **Quantum Music Generation** as a new area of research. These projects collectively emphasize **implementation and expansion**, ensuring that previous research transitions into **functional, testable systems**.  

## Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre Production  

A major focus is the **BSP Theatre production**, which expands upon last year’s performance by:  
- **Adding a second scene**
  - The first scene, telling the origin of the Mango-merchant brothers will be reproduced, and the   
- **Increasing the scope of theatre space**
  -  Adding additional projectors: both in space and with  Front and rear projection.
  -  Experimenting with different type of projection screen fabrics.
  -  Constructing a more enclosed environment to mitigate external lighting and sounds
- **Enhancing puppetry action**
  -  New puppets and
  -  new fabrication techniques
  -  Engineered scaleable articulation elements
- **Developing an immersive audio environment**
  -  Moving from a primitive four channel system to at least 8
  -  Perhaps implementing ATMOS
- **Using student-composed music**
  - Developing Gamelan/Yoruba inspired music
  - Implementing this as a Virtual Orchestra

**Sam Cheung and Tshari Yancey** lead this effort, integrating **physical and virtual puppetry** with **AI-generated assets, advanced fabrication techniques, and expanded world-building**. **Osakpolor Noyiagbon** is composing an original score influenced by **Javanese gamelan and electronic music**, while **Benjamin (MET)** is refining **puppet articulation and armature systems** to improve movement and expressiveness. **Anthony Navarro** will serve as AV designer/Technologist, investigating projection techniques and designing the immersive audio system based around QLab. 

## Shadow Puppet Virtual World & Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)  

The **Shadow Puppet Virtual World Team** (**Hugo Sanchez and Rodrigo Vega**) is building a **prototype Unreal Engine environment** to **simulate Javanese shadow puppetry**, accurately recreating how **light, shadow, and screen-based performance** function in a virtual space. this will serve as the platform upon which a **Balanced Blended Environment** can be developed for these shadow puppet performances.

This project contributes directly to the **Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)**, which explores the **seamless integration of physical and virtual performance modalities**. Many of the **BSP projects support BRPS development**, testing how **light, shadow, and interactive elements** can be blended across platforms.  

## Quantum Music Project  

The **Quantum Music Project**, involving a team of student researchers with theoretical input from **Dr. Oleg Berman**, investigates:  
- **Algorithmic composition**  
- **Quantum-based music generation**  

This expands CHI’s research into **computational creativity** and explores new frontiers in **technology-driven musical systems**.  As well it explores collaborative AI under the BBS model.  

## CHI Infrastructure & Public Identity  

Infrastructure development continues with the **CHI Integrated Digital System (CHIIDS)**, designed to:  
- **Streamline project organization**  
- **Store research assets**  
- **Facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration**  

The **CHI Visual and Public Identity Team**, led by **Kevin Pintado and Alexandra Tourkova**, is refining:  
- **Branding and visual identity**  
- **Website updates**  
- **Digital integration**  

Their work ensures a **unified public identity** for all CHI projects.  

## Summary  

This semester’s work marks a transition into **prototyping and application**, ensuring that ongoing research efforts in **BSP Theatre, BRPS, Unreal Engine simulation, Quantum Music, and CHIIDS** contribute to a **scalable and structured interdisciplinary framework**.  








This semester, CHI student participants are
