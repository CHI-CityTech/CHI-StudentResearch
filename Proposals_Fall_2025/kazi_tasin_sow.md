## 1. Project Overview
City Tech is emerging as a **global connector** in technology, culture, and AI.  
The **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)** functions as the internal ecosystem that links research, education, and innovation across departments, institutions, and international partners.

As Head of the Student Data Science Club, **Kazi Tasin** will organize, classify, and expand City Tech’s interdisciplinary reach through CHI’s integrated digital framework—the **CHI Integrated Digital System (CHIIDS)**.  
This work positions City Tech as a **collaborative node in global education and AI research**, aligned with CHI’s UNESCO and international partnerships.

## 2. Core Objectives
1. **Institutional Integration** – Map and connect City Tech research, labs, and student clubs through CHI’s integrative frameworks.  
2. **Strategic Growth** – Develop analytic methods to identify and align emerging opportunities with existing CHI initiatives.  
3. **Global Outreach** – Represent City Tech in local, national, and international contexts, forming academic and entrepreneurial collaborations.  
4. **Collaborative AI Implementation** – Use AI tools to enhance research mapping, outreach analysis, and interdisciplinary coordination.  
5. **Meta-Project Development** – Discover and articulate patterns that can evolve into new CHI meta-projects or cross-institutional partnerships.

## 3. Tasks and Deliverables

| **Phase** | **Focus Area** | **Key Deliverables** |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **1. Mapping & Integration Research** | Survey existing City Tech projects and student initiatives aligned with CHI themes (AI, heritage, blended reality, sustainability). | • Integration map linking City Tech entities to CHI meta-projects  • Preliminary data schema for CHIIDS |
| **2. Data Organization & Infrastructure** | Classify and structure project data for visibility and interoperability inside CHIIDS. | • Structured dataset or GitHub repository  • Cross-linked summaries of CHI-affiliated activities |
| **3. Institutional Outreach & Representation** | Attend meetings, present to departments and external organizations, articulate the CHI/City Tech integration vision. | • Presentation decks and outreach summaries  • Contact and collaboration logs |
| **4. Global Integration Analysis** | Identify collaboration opportunities with UNESCO, Modul University Vienna, and other partners. | • Analysis of potential international alignments  • Summary report for future proposals |
| **5. Reporting & Dissemination** | Publish internal updates and reflect on AI collaboration and integrative practice. | • AI collaboration log  • End-of-semester integration report  • CRSP/ESP poster presentation |

## 7. Strategic Alignment
This SoW frames **City Tech as the larger entity**—a global institution advancing integration and collaboration through the CHI ecosystem.  
CHI serves as the infrastructure that connects research, technology, and culture into a unified system of innovation.  
Through this work, Kazi Tasin helps define how City Tech models institutional integration and global partnership in the age of AI.
