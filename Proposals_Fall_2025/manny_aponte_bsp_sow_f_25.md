# Manny Aponte — BSP Video Documentation Internship
**Statement of Work (SoW)**  
**Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)**  
**Meta-Project:** *Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)*  
**Term:** Fall 2025  
**Student Intern:** Manny Aponte

## 1. Project Overview
This internship focuses on the **archival collation, editing, and curation** of existing video materials documenting the *Blended Shadow Puppet* meta-project.  
All footage and recordings are pre-existing or will be supplied by other CHI team members.  
Manny Aponte will operate as a **post-production editor and media curator**, producing concise documentary shorts from CHI’s collected materials while refining his workflow in **Adobe Premiere Pro** and related **Creative Cloud** tools (After Effects, Audition, Photoshop).  
The completed works will enhance CHI’s **Living Archive** and support BSP public engagement.

## 2. Purpose and Objectives
- Develop professional fluency in **Premiere Pro** as the primary editing environment.  
- Integrate prior experience in **Avid** and **DaVinci Resolve** into an efficient cross-platform post-production workflow.  
- Catalog, organize, and log existing BSP video assets within CHIIDS standards.  
- Edit and deliver a variable set of **short-form documentaries** (from a few seconds to ≈ 2 minutes).  
- Contribute finished, branded media pieces suitable for web, social, and internal use.  
- Document and publish repeatable archival and editorial workflows for future CHI teams.

### C. Documentation and Workflow Integration
- Maintain detailed editorial logs (source references, version notes, time tracking).  
- Deposit all project files, EDLs, and exported media in the CHIIDS repository.
