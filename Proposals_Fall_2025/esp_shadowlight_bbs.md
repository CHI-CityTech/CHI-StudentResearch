# ESR Project Proposal (ESP Application Draft)

## 3. Title of Project
**Shadows and Light: Play Mechanics of Foreground/Background Ambiguity**

---

## 4.a) Description of Project  
This Emerging Scholars project is part of the **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)** meta-project ecosystem. It investigates how the **ambiguity of foreground and background**—a central theme in perception, culture, and symbolic systems—can be transformed into **basic play mechanics** for interactive design.  

The project draws from:  
- **Wayang Kulit** and other shadow/light cultural practices,  
- **M.C. Escher** and Gestalt figure/ground illusions, and  
- Precedent games like *Shift* that invert black/white relationships.  

The focus is not on building full digital games but on **conceptualizing and prototyping mechanics** (via sketches, rulesets, or paper models). Students will generate at least **two to three distinct mechanics** that embody reversibility and ambiguity, then evaluate them for cultural and narrative resonance within CHI’s **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)** fictive world.  

This aligns directly with the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework, which models how meaning and agency emerge from mediated interactions across **conceptual, physical, and virtual spaces**. In this context, figure/ground reversibility is treated as both a **symbolic metaphor** and a **computational design principle**.

## 4.b) This project is:  
☑ Interdisciplinary (ID)

---

## 4.c) This project is:  
☑ Group (if multiple students) / □ Individual  
*(If group: list names of students involved; otherwise mark “Individual.”)*

---

## 5. Student Role  
Students will:  
- Conduct precedent research in cultural performance, perception, and interactive media.  
- Brainstorm and document **candidate play mechanics**.  
- Produce **sketches, flowcharts, and paper prototypes**.  
- Map each mechanic into the **BBS framework**, showing how agents, signals, and spaces interact.  
- Prepare final poster and abstract situating their work within CHI’s broader meta-projects.  

---

## 6. Research Skills to Be Learned  
- **Game design fundamentals**: mechanics, dynamics, feedback loops.  
- **Cultural and perceptual research**: analyzing figure/ground illusions and shadow traditions.  
- **BBS syntax application**: modeling mechanics in terms of Source–Vector–Destination pathways.  
- **Design documentation**: iterative sketches, prototypes, and comparative analysis.  
- **Interdisciplinary integration**: linking cultural heritage, psychology, and computational design.  

---

## 7. Soft Skills to Be Addressed  
- Goal setting (aligning sub-projects with CHI meta-project pathways).  
- Time management across iterative cycles (Research, Design, Produce, Publish, Assess).  
- Professional communication (framing mechanics for scholarly and cultural audiences).  
- Networking/making connections (linking student work to CHI, BBS, and CUNY-wide collaborations).  
- Guidance in academic and career planning (how conceptual research in games can feed future projects in design, AI, or cultural heritage).  

---

## 8. Student Contribution  
Students will commit ~6 hours per week. They will maintain a **research/design log** documenting iterations of mechanics, cultural precedents, and BBS mappings. Each week they will bring prepared sketches or prototypes to mentor meetings for critique. Quality will be assessed on clarity of design articulation, research depth, and integration with CHI/BBS frameworks.  

---

## 9. Faculty Mentor Contribution  
The faculty mentor will meet weekly, provide iterative feedback, and help students **situate their mechanics in the broader CHI meta-project landscape**. Feedback will emphasize both technical clarity (are the mechanics well-defined?) and conceptual integration (how do they reflect BBS principles of mediation, symmetry, and blended space?). The mentor will also connect students to external opportunities, including CHIIDS repositories, poster sessions, and future cross-campus collaborations.
